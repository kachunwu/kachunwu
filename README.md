# Portfolio
This is a portfolio that I constantly updated.

## About me
Hi, I’m @kachunwu from Hong Kong. Working as a researcher in the university, my primary job duty is to manage and analyse data consisting psychological measures. I’m currently learning multiple languages, including Python, R, SQL, and Matlab, each for their specialized features. All my coding and programming skills are self-learning so it may be wild.

## Featured Repositories

[hk-school-contact](https://github.com/kachunwu/hk-school-contact): Python-based web scraper that helps me scrap the school information from Education Bureau of HKSAR
(This is a skill-test project that I used to train myself doing webscraping. A more accurate official data would be from [data.gov.hk](https://data.gov.hk))

[eeg_preprocessing_pipeline](https://github.com/kachunwu/eeg_preprocessing_pipeline): My preprocessing pipeline for my MPhil thesis

[LiteartureReviewBot](https://github.com/kachunwu/n8n-workflow-for-academic/tree/main/workflow/LiteratureReviewBot): A n8n workflow I built to write literature review for my research. (Again, a practice project to train myself to AI agent automation.)
