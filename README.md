Hi, I’m @kachunwu from Hong Kong. Working as a researcher in the university, my primary job duty is to manage and analyse data consisting psychological measures. My specialty is in cognitive neuroscience, especially neuroimaging techniques. I’m currently learning multiple languages, including Python, R, SQL, and Matlab, each for their specialized features.

I am also having some private project related to analytics about the video game industry, ChatGPT and some other stuffs. If you want to have collaboration with me, feel free to send me a email!
